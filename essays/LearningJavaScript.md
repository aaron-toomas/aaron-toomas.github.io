  JavaScript is an interesting language to learn. With only having experience with Java, C, and C++, JavaScript was easy to learn and pick up. The language followed a similar style of formatting as the other programming languages. It took some getting used to the instantiation of variables since the data type of the variable could be anything. The language’s flexibility and features allow for creative and optimized solutions to problems that other coding languages cannot do. 
  
  Learning the language with freeCodeCamp.org made the process easier since the material was taught concisely. Each activity on the site was well thought out and the order it was presented in made learning a lot easier. The activities build upon each other furthering the understanding of JavaScript. The only downside to this process is the main portion of the language is taught in ES5, but the course uses ES6. Even though there is a module that goes over the changes in ES6, the bulk of the material is taught in ES5 and the changes were a little jarring. It would have been easier if ES6 was taught initially and a shorter module explaining what changed from ES5 was present. Overall, the website was useful in learning a new language in a fairly short amount of time. 
  
  To further solidify the knowledge in JavaScript, the Workout Of the Day (WOD) is a beneficial tool. WODs are practice problems that require code in JavaScript to solve a problem. This is useful with thinking of coding on the spot and identifying common themes to solve future prompts. The course is set up in a way that is helpful to learn JavaScript if one has prior experience with programming since it is fast-paced. However, a complete beginner in programming would struggle since a lot of new concepts are being thrown at them rapidly. 
  
  JavaScript is a powerful coding language that every software developer should learn. ICS 314 provides an efficient way to learn the language while working on professional computer skills. Adding JavaScript to one’s repertoire is highly recommended.
