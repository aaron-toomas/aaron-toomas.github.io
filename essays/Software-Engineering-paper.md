Software engineering is a vast and growing field in todayâ€™s times and there are many job opportunities that are opening in the field. The increase in demand of software engineers needs to be filled to help further the advancement of technology. Software engineering is a good opportunity to learn more about how certain applications and services run. These are all important reasons that I want to learn more about software engineering. 
I took AP Computer Science in high school, and it got me hooked on coding. I enjoyed making something that did not require physical work, and still seeing results that are satisfying. I also enjoy learning new languages and, in a way, learning programming is a like learning a new language. Each different programming language has its own nuances that make it different from others. 
I hope to develop my skill in finding bugs and errors. In all my previous programming endeavors, I have spent a lot of time trying to find what is wrong with my code and waste resources mindlessly. I hope to spend less time in the process and be more efficient with my time. Another thing that I hope is learn is new and powerful coding languages. The more programming languages that I add to my arsenal, that more successful I can be with future projects.
